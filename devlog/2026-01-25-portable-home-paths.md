# Portable Home Paths - 2026-01-25

## Session Summary

Replaced hardcoded home directory paths (`/home/neil/` and `/Users/neil/`) with the portable `$HOME` environment variable across shell configuration files.

## Work Completed

### Path Audit
- Searched entire dotfiles repo for hardcoded `/home/neil/` and `/Users/neil/` paths
- Identified which paths were inside platform-specific conditional blocks (left as-is)
- Identified which paths were outside conditionals (fixed)

### Files Modified
- `zsh/.zshrc` - Claude alias and LM Studio path
- `bash/.profile` - LM Studio path
- `fzf/.fzf.bash` - fzf bin path

### Files Left Unchanged (Inside Platform Conditionals)
- `bash/.profile` lines 69, 72 - BOOKMARKS variable in `case "$(uname -s)"` block
- `.config/fish/config.fish` lines 18-24 - Inside `if test (uname -s) = "Darwin"` block

## Commits Made

- `40e987d` - fix: replace hardcoded home paths with $HOME for portability

## Key Files

- `zsh/.zshrc`
- `bash/.profile`
- `fzf/.fzf.bash`

## Notes

- The `fish_variables` file also contains hardcoded paths but is auto-generated by fish shell
- The `git/.gitmodules` file has an old submodule path that may need separate attention
