# Git Sync Date Command and Conventions Setup - 2026-01-12

## Session Summary

Added explicit runtime date checking to the git-sync command and established global Git Commit Conventions using Conventional Commits format.

## Work Completed

### Git-Sync Enhancement
- Added `date` command as step 1 in Phase 1 Pre-flight Check
- Ensures current timestamp is captured at runtime rather than assumed
- Fixed numbering in the phase steps after insertion

### Global Git Commit Conventions
- Created `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with Conventional Commits format
- Defined commit types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Added message format templates and examples

### Stow Configuration
- Moved `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to `~/dotfiles/claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Created symlink via stow for cross-machine portability

## Commits Made

1. `c00b65d` - feat: add date check to git-sync and new claude commands
   - Added date command to git-sync Phase 1
   - Added chat-export.md and rn.md commands

2. `5578d97` - feat: add global CLAUDE.md with git commit conventions
   - Establishes Conventional Commits as default format

## Key Files

- `claude/.claude/commands/git-sync.md` - Modified to add date command
- `claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - New global conventions file
- `claude/.claude/commands/chat-export.md` - New command (unrelated to main work)
- `claude/.claude/commands/rn.md` - New command (unrelated to main work)

## Notes

- The git-sync skill now explicitly runs `date` to ensure accurate timestamps
- Conventional Commits format chosen for consistency across repositories
- Global CLAUDE.md is now managed via stow for easy deployment to other machines
